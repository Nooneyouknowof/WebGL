# Makeing a Voxel engine(Minecraft Clone) with WebGL

### Made by: Ethan McNaughton

## Includes/Progress:
- Vertex Shader
- Fragment Shader
- Matrix Manipultation
- Trigonometry (3D to 2D transformations)

## Up and comming:
- Refined Player Controls
- Entity models
- Textures
- Shading
- UI's
- Particles
- 3D Realtime Physics
- Music/Sound Effects
- Sound Cues
- Lore
- Multiplayer
- Boss-Fights (Maybe)
- Cinematic Scenes
- Porting over to C++/C# programming Language
- Modding
- Monitization (Maybe)

## Optimizations:
- Bitwise Greedy Meshing (Combines adjacent Meshes to reduce draw calls)
- Parallel Processing (similar to Vulkan)
- GPU Compute Shaders (sideloads object-shading to the GPU)
- Temporal Techniques (temporal anti-aliasing, temporal accumulation) (Maybe)
- LOD (Level of Detail) (Maybe)
